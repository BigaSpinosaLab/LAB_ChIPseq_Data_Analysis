##       User defined parameters for ChIP-seq data analysis
################################################################################

# 1) SPECIFY Root directory in the cluster (usually /projects/cancer)
/projects/cancer

# 2) Specify project name. It will be used in final reports title (FASTQC/MULTIQC)
ChIPseq_TF_X_Cell_Line_Y

# 3) SPECIFY your project working directory (Don't include Root)
ABigas/Project_folder_name/ChIPseq_TF_X

# 4) Folder where Bowtie index is stored (Don't include Root), required for alignment
db_files/Genomes/Ensembl/human/hg38/release-106/Bowtie2_index

# 5) SPECIFY your FASTA reference genome (Don't include Root) required for index building: FASTA
db_files/Genomes/Ensembl/human/hg38/release-106/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa

# 6) SPECIFY NAME you wanna use for index files basename
hg38_Ensembl_r106

# 7) SPECIFY if your data is PAIRED or SINGLE end, required for trimming and alignment
PAIRED

# 8) Folder where BED file with BlackListed regions is stored, required for removing 
# blacklisted regions. Don't include Root in your path.
db_files/Blacklisted_Regions/hg38-blacklist.v2_woCHR.bed

# 9) SPECIFY your samplesheet (txt) filename required for BigWig creation. 
# THIS IS MANDATORY FOR SINGLE-END READS, NOT REQUIRED FOR PAIRED-END READS
# This samplesheet must include one line per sample and corresponding extension length:
# 'sample;extension_length'. Always left an empty line at the end of the file.
# Indicate the complete BAM filename stored in BAM_Markdup folder
# STORE THIS FILE IN THE 'BIGWIG' SUBFOLDER. Do not inlcude WKD path
BigWig/Samples_ChIP_TF_X.txt

# 10) Specify the corresponding genome size required for BigWig creation
# Recommended to use these ones adapted to read length 
# https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html
# As an example for hg38 50bp read length 
2701495711 

# 11) SPECIFY the file name where the sample;input is included required for peak calling. 
# Single end data should indicated corresponding fragment length as well sample;input;fragment
# Always left an empty line at the end of the file. Indicate the complete BAM filenames 
# STORED IN THE 'MACS2_peak_calling'/'epic2_peak_calling' 
# SUBFOLDER (txt file here as well). Do not inlcude WKD path.
MACS2_peak_calling/Samples_Input_ChIP_TF_X.txt

# 12) Define the chromosome sizes file, only required for epic2 peak calling
db_files/Genomes/Ensembl/human/hg38/release-106/hg38_Ensembl_r106_chrom.sizes'

# 13) Genome size fraction. About the effective genome size, only required for epic2 peak calling
# Example for mm10 == 2308125349/2730871774 = 0.8451973
# We will use the same as considered for deepTools 
# https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html
# Effective genome size mm10 50bp read length: 2308125349 # ADAPT IN FUNCTION OF READ LENGTH
# Genome length: 2,730,871,774 http://nov2020.archive.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Info/Annotation
0.8451973

# 14) SPECIFY how many characters you wanna cut (suffix) from the BAM (Mark-dup) filenames 
# to appear as sample label in the corr plots, QC fingerprints i.e. if you wanna remove:
# "R1_001_trimmed.sorted.unique.markdup.filtered_blacklisted.bam" you should specify 61
61

# 15) SPECIFY length to extend reads required for fingerprint plotting.
# Extension value is the most representative for all samples (fragment size)
180

# 16) SPECIFY the filename where the bed;name is located required for density/profiles plotting.
# 'bed' refers to the name of the bedfile (just the filename) which should be stored in Other/Profiles
# 'name' just refers to the label for that list of genomic regions
# You can include more than one BED file. One per line.
# Always left an empty line at the end of the file
Regions_of_interest.bed

# 17) SPECIFY how many characters you wanna cut (suffix) from the BigWig filenames 
# to appear as sample label in the density plots
83

# 18) SPECIFY the distance to and from the reference point required for density plotting
# Distance BEFORE the reference point (it can be different from next one)
3000

# 19) SPECIFY the distance to and from the reference point required for density plotting
# Distance AFTER the reference point
3000
